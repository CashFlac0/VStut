            <h2>Boeing vs Airbus</h2>
            The biggest difference between a Boeing and an Airbus cockpit is that the Boeing uses a conventional yoke,
            and
            Airbus uses a side stick. According to Airbus, the side stick makes it easier to fly the aircraft because,
            with
            armrests correctly set, only very fine wrist movements are required to maneuver the aircraft.
